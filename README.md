vim-gitwildignore
=================

Install and every file/directory in your projects `.gitignore` files will be
appended to your wildignore. Useful when accompanied with the
[ctrlp.vim][ctrlp] plugin.

There's another [fork][fork] by @mikewadsten that may work better for you, but
it depends on other plugins while the original and this fork don't.

ToDo
----

Also find and parse `.git/info/exclude`.
